# Find-A-Friend

Welcome to Find-A-Friend! A full-stacked web application that allows users with similar opinions and beliefs!

When you click "Take the Quiz" on the home page, you will be redirected to the survey page. After you answer questions where you give your opinion ranging from Strongly Agree (value of 1) to Strongly Disagree (value of 5) and the hit "Submit" (don't forget to answer each question and provide a name, pic and quote are optional), you will be shown a user who answered the survey similarly to you! The survey.html page makes calculations (your values for each question versus each other's user value for that question) in relation to each other user who already submitted a survey, by picking at random a user who had similar scores
